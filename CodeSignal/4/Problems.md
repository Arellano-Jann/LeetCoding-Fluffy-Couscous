# Problem 1

You are given an array of integers numbers and two integers left and right. You task is to calculate a boolean array result, where result[i] = true if there exists an integer x, such that numbers[i] = (i + 1) * x and left ≤ x ≤ right. Otherwise, result[i] should be set to false.

Example

For numbers = [8, 5, 6, 16, 5], left = 1, and right = 3, the output should be solution(numbers, left, right) = [false, false, true, false, true].

For numbers[0] = 8, we need to find a value of x such that 1 * x = 8, but the only value that would work is x = 8 which doesn't satisfy the boundaries 1 ≤ x ≤ 3, so result[0] = false.
For numbers[1] = 5, we need to find a value of x such that 2 * x = 5, but there is no integer value that would satisfy this equation, so result[1] = false.
For numbers[2] = 6, we can choose x = 2 because 3 * 2 = 6 and 1 ≤ 2 ≤ 3, so result[2] = true.
For numbers[3] = 16, there is no an integer 1 ≤ x ≤ 3, such that 4 * x = 16, so result[3] = false.
For numbers[4] = 5, we can choose x = 1 because 5 * 1 = 5 and 1 ≤ 1 ≤ 3, so result[4] = true.

# Problem 2

You are given an array of non-negative integers numbers. You are allowed to choose any number from this array and swap any two digits in it. If after the swap operation the number contains leading zeros, they can be omitted and not considered (eg: 010 will be considered just 10).

Your task is to check whether it is possible to apply the swap operation at most once, so that the elements of the resulting array are strictly increasing.

Example

For numbers = [1, 5, 10, 20], the output should be solution(numbers) = true.

The initial array is already strictly increasing, so no actions are required.

For numbers = [1, 3, 900, 10], the output should be solution(numbers) = true.

By choosing numbers[2] = 900 and swapping its first and third digits, the resulting number 009 is considered to be just 9. So the updated array will look like [1, 3, 9, 10], which is strictly increasing.

For numbers = [13, 31, 30], the output should be solution(numbers) = false.

The initial array elements are not increasing.
By swapping the digits of numbers[0] = 13, the array becomes [31, 31, 30] which is not strictly increasing;
By swapping the digits of numbers[1] = 31, the array becomes [13, 13, 30] which is not strictly increasing;
By swapping the digits of numbers[2] = 30, the array becomes [13, 31, 3] which is not strictly increasing;
So, it's not possible to obtain a strictly increasing array, and the answer is false.

# Problem 3 (Too Tired to have Attempted)

You are given an array of strings arr. Your task is to construct a string from the words in arr, starting with the 0th character from each word (in the order they appear in arr), followed by the 1st character, then the 2nd character, etc. If one of the words doesn't have an ith character, skip that word.

Return the resulting string.

Example

For arr = ["Daisy", "Rose", "Hyacinth", "Poppy"], the output should be solution(arr) = "DRHPaoyoisapsecpyiynth".

First, we append all 0th characters and obtain string "DRHP";
Then we append all 1st characters and obtain string "DRHPaoyo";
Then we append all 2nd characters and obtain string "DRHPaoyoisap";
Then we append all 3rd characters and obtain string "DRHPaoyoisapsecp";
Then we append all 4th characters and obtain string "DRHPaoyoisapsecpyiy";
Finally, only letters in the arr[2] are left, so we append the rest characters and get "DRHPaoyoisapsecpyiynth";
example

For arr = ["E", "M", "I", "L", "Y"], the output should be solution(arr) = "EMILY".

Since each of these strings have only one character, the answer will be concatenation of each string in order, so the answer is EMILY.

# Problem 4

You are given an array of integers a and an integer k. Your task is to calculate the number of ways to pick two different indices i < j, such that a[i] + a[j] is divisible by k.

Example

For a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and k = 3, the output should be solution(a, k) = 4.

There are 4 pairs of numbers that sum to a multiple of k = 3:

a[0] + a[1] = 1 + 2 = 3
a[0] + a[4] = 1 + 5 = 6
a[1] + a[3] = 2 + 4 = 6
a[3] + a[4] = 4 + 5 = 9
